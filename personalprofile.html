<h1>Personal Profile</h1>

<h2>Myers-Briggs Test</h2>
<p> The results of my Myers-Briggs test show that I have a
<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality">INFJ </a>
or an "advocate" personality type. This personality type is regarded as rare as stated in the test website making up
one percent of the whole population which means that for me this fits well with my actions, thoughts, and opinons generally speaking
which I tend to try my best to see through my goals whilst having an important and lasting impact not only to myself but 
to other people as well. With this I believe this has a postive influence my behaviour in working with a team as I find it easy to 
make connections and strike up conversations with others as I value teamwork and also believe that forming bonds with people and helping
them as much as I can to accomplish tasks and our own goals is better than doing it by yourself since both myself and my teammates would 
grow and learn together along the way. The downside of my personality type is that I tend to be sensitive at times and I believe that would
affect my mood strongly if a a teammate would give me criticism. Moreover, I get easly burned out which would 
affect my productivity and work which can lead to problems with working with a team. When forming a team, my INFJ personality would be
taken into account as my personality type has the possibility to clash with other personality types. Meaning that I would need to 
choose or join a team where I feel that I would fit right in and do work well with.

<h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
<p>
    Based on the learning style test im more of a pragmatist style learner, meaning that I need to be able to see how I could utilise
    what i've learned into practise in the real world. I like trying out new ideas and experimenting on it to test if it works or not.
    My other secondary, tertiary, and quaternary learning styles namely theorist, reflector, and activist respectively. This result of my learning
    style would influence my behaviour on a team as I learn through trying out new ideas and work well in discussions so I would be able to take advantage
    and learn from others as well in trying to complete a task. The downside is that I may lose interest or patience on lengthy discussions which 
    might be a problem during team meetings or similar events. My pragmatist learning style would be taken into account when forming teams as I need to
    keep in mind that with working alongside teammates I should try and work with people who values and open to trying out and experimenting various ways or
    solutions to a problem or task that we need to do or accomplish.

<h3>Big Five factors Personality Test</h3>
<p>
    The results from my big five factors show that agreeableness which is factor 3, is my highest raw score comapred to the other factors.
    This means that I am friendly and optimistic which is traits that is very useful especially when working with people in a team. My second highest 
    raw score is factor 4 which is conscientiousness, which tells me that I am a individual who is careful and diligent which allows me to not recklessly decide
    on what to do with tasks especially under pressure. My third highest raw score is factor 1 which is extroversion. It remarks that people like me who score high on this factor are outgoing and social which is
    a good attribute to have in working with a team as I will not have too much of a problem interacting or introducing myself to my teammates and 
    teammates would be able to easily approach me. Furthermore, this attribute helps my behaviour in a way that when I try to express my thoughts and feelings
    towards tasks to my group, I would not have too much of a hard time and communicate it to them effectively. These top three from my big five 
    factors personality test is taken into account when forming a team as these factors generally has an impact on how I work with share a bond with my
    teammates. In a way, this would allow me to look into myself first before reaching a decision in situations where I need to pick my own team members or any similar
    events where I have the freedom to join a pre-existing team. Moreover, working in a team means that you have to trust and know your peers which, when forming a team 
    is usually the first step in building trust with your new teammates which means that my personalty factors would come into play and serve as a reference for me.
