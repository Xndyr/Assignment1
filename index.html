							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
                        <p>Hello! My name is Ahlyk Xandyr Beredo (Student number s3781189) and I was born and raised in the Philippines. I speak English and two of the main languages spoken mostly in my country namely Tagalog which is the main language of my country and Cebuano which is the widely spoken language in the southern Philippines.  </p>
                        <p>I finished up my primary and high-school years upto year 10 on 2016 in an educational institution called 
                        <a href="http://www.addu.edu.ph/">Ateneo de Davao University</a>
                        which is located in Davao city, Mindanao, Philippines. I arrived and started living in Melbourne halfway through 2016 and immedietly started half of year 10 again since its too late for me to 
						go into year 11 in the middle of the school year to get ready for VCE which I had no prior knowledge of how significant it is in getting into a course in university. It took a while adjusting to my new environment
						and pushed through VCE eventually and recieved my VCE certificate and required ATAR in the last months of 2018 which brings me now to my current course studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My hobbies and interests include playing basketball, listening to music, watching movies or shows, playing video games, and watch videos on how stuff works including
						new developments in technology and other related fields in my pastime. 
						</p>
						<h3>Why I.T?</h3>
                    <p>
						Information technology has always sparked my interest ever since I was introduced to my very own smartphone and an iPad second generation that I had back in the early
						days of highschool around 2012. Those devices enabled me to access the internet at my fingertips with ease and play games portably which before I could only do
						on our family computer and my Playstation portable (PSP). I never had any smartphone or touch screen devices prior so I was really interested in exploring and 
						utilising it almost everyday with it. School work has been easier and the exposure to what was going on and the develompents such as in that year where the Google glass
						was mainly talked about and I dreamt of having one since Gooogle showed ads on how it shows you the weather, integration with google maps in front of your eyes is very appealing
						to the 12 year old me. Furthermore, my school offered an I.T course each year so when I was a freshman (year 7) the same year, our course was getting familiar and building
						computer components such as the getting familiar and the dissasembly of the cpu and whatnot, year 8 we played around with Adobe flash and photoshop and made our own animations, year 9 where we did basic JavaScript creating
						websites like these, and in year 10 where we did the C++ programming language where we were tasked in creating programs with various functions such as logging in and referencing data connected to 
						Microsoft Excel as our database. These courses and experiences allowed me to have a feel on how things worked behind the scenes in the digital world and from the moment that I had full exposure to 
						the internet and the latest technology and innovations, I believe that technology is constantly evolving which is one of many driving forces that allowed me to further want to explore and study I.T in 
						higher education.

						<h2>I.T at RMIT and what jobs or projects do I plan in doing?</h2>
						<div class="container-fluid">
							Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
							<p> I chose to come and study at RMIT because when I was year 10 to year 12, my school provided us with brochures and activities
								 that allowed us to browse through different options and pathways in undertaking our chosen field of study. For me personally, I had no
								  idea and not familiar with the different universities in Melbourne as I was a fairly new student and resident in Australia during the 
								  last years of secondary school and my school really helped me weigh in my options. Guest presenters and advice from my careers teacher
								 enabled me to take their recommendation to study I.T in RMIT and furthermore, having went to the open days and browsing through RMIT’s website, 
								 it became clear that the university is a great institution to undertake my studies in and to be a part of, representing RMIT’s values. Moreover, during
								  the open days I was able to have a good look on the services and amenities available for students which further influenced my decision. In addition, RMIT 
								   is situated in the city which makes it accessible when I’m in the area plus the ease of going to the shops in the city.  
								</p>
							
							What do you expect to learn during your studies?
							<p> During my studies, I expect to learn how programs, applications, and the how digital information and innovations work behind the scenes. I want to learn and apply 
								information such as creating programs and using it to my advantage when trying to solve a problem in the real world. I also expect to learn skills that would enable 
								me to have the qualifications for a future job or project. In reference to why I chose to study the I.T field when I was young, I was always curious and wanted to make 
								programs which requires factors such as the code, structure, how data is processed and the external factors which help the program to run smoothly. As with all things, 
								mistakes and problems or errors cannot be avoided therefore, I would like to learn how to debug and solve problems that I might encounter and the alternative ways I could be able to go pass through it. 
							  </p>
							  
							<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
							<a href="#" class="image job"></a><image src="images/job.jpg" width="454" height="874" alt=""/></a>
							<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50381290?type=standard#searchRequestToken=fa51d00d-497f-47c8-9643-fb2c9affdced">Job link</a>
						   
							<p>My ideal job would probably be being a software and application developer. What makes this job appealing is the idea of making something from the ground up and having functions that can be utilized and 
								hopefully enjoyed by other people.This job area will require UI/UX knowledge and background and of course knowledge and experience with various programming languages just to name a few. Currently, I have
								basic knowledge on basic principles in User centered design as I am undertaking that course as well and basic knowledge on programming languages such as C++ and JavaScript but I would like to learn more and
								acquire more knowledge and skills needed in the workforce as I progress through my degree. I plan to obtain these skills, knowledge, and experiences as mentioned by progressing through my courses and also studying
								aspects in my own free time. During the duration of studying my course especially during the final year, I intend on looking for apprenticeships or programs that would help me have at least experience outside the university
								to make sure I get the experience and skills needed by most employers. Of course the skills and knowledge is ever changing in the I.T field which I need to keep up with and make sure I learn what I can and need to succeed in finding a job.

						   <h4>Project Idea</h4>
						   
						   Overview
						   <p>My project idea involves creating a game that informs people playing the game and spread awareness on one of the current pressing issues our society and perhaps the whole world is dealing with which is climate change. It will have a storyline
							and interactive parts that would encourage players to engage and be knowledgeable on the facts about the pressing issue of climate change in the world and how it affects our society currently and give a glimpse on things that might happen when its too
							 late and the effects of climate change is irreversible. This game would be developed using game engines such as Unity but specifics would be discussed later on.
							</p>
							Motivation
							<p>I think this project will be useful and interesting due to the fact that climate change is a serious and pressing issue that is currently ongoing at this moment. With that being said, I believe that before its too late and the effects are irreversible it’s
							a good idea to spread awareness through a game that can be played by the audience, regardless of their age especially a younger audience as they are the next generation. According to NASA’s global climate change report, our planet has been getting an average surface
							temperature rising about 0.9 Celsius since the late 19th century. According to NASA’s global climate change report, our planet has been getting an average surface temperature rising about 0.9 Celsius since the late 19th century. This project would help point this out by
							showing players digitally what’s currently happening and what might happen in the future if this problem is not solved.
						   </p>
						   Description 
						   <p>What I’m thinking of the features that will be included in this game to fully achieve its intended purpose while providing players a solid gameplay experience is to firstly start in making a storyline that can be influenced by the actions of the player and can branch out
							to various events and endings. Every action they take inside the game world would influence the overall storyline of the game while along the way, they would be exposed to real world facts regarding climate change. For example, the player is given a scenario later on in the story
							where he or she would be faced with a decision where he or she must choose to either sacrifice something may it be relating to maybe refusing to build or take advantage of plastics or coal factories that spew out toxic and harmful chemicals in the atmosphere and rivers, something along
							those lines of scenarios or choose to ignore the warnings and information the game gives the player be it a cutscene of a news report or a NPC bringing it up earlier on which would drastically affect the outcome and storyline chosen by the player which would eventually lead to the aftermath
							of climate change which is of course based on imagination and a bit of fiction since thankfully we have not reached a critical point of no return regarding the full harmful effects of what climate change might bring but also a bit factual as well as scenarios on that would be based on the reports
							or findings of researchers who would construct a scenario of what will might happen based on what’s happening in the real world currently. The game will also feature a link to services or websites that further explains the severity and facts about climate change to further educate players on the prevalent topic.  

						   </p>
						   Tools and Technologies
						   <p>Firstly, to put this idea into fruition, hardware, software, and other tools and equipment is needed. I’m thinking utilising software such as Unity as mentioned and maybe unreal engine 4 for the game engine. If me and my would be team of developers would come up and decide what style or type the overall game is be it
							a 2-D or mainly 3-D with elements of 2-D incorporated with it, software such as photoshop is needed especially for 2-D and if we decide on 3-D models to use, 3-D modelling software such as Blender or Maya. Some of these have a premium version so that would probably be purchased as functionality will be limited behind that
							subscription or price so might as well take advantage of the full version rather than settling for the free version while missing out on the features that might be beneficial in making the game. With every software, a good hardware is needed if you want to run the software and programs without any hitch or problems so computers
							with average or standard specifications regarding its parts such as  processors and the amount of memory and RAM it has is acceptable as I think although it will be good to have high end or expensive parts and components, it does not have to follow or utilise that unless my development team would run into problems initially and decide to upgrade. 

						   </p>
						   Skills required
						   <p>The skills required for this project includes developers involved including myself to have a background on I.T specifically in the software development and game design. As mentioned in the tools and technologies written, Unity or Unreal engine will be primarily used as the game engine and with it its programming language that is needed to be learnt
							and familiarise with in order for the game to function properly. This includes learning the skill and fundamentals of programming languages such as C#. As for the hardware there isn’t really anything special or high end needed in order for the game to be made and be functional, acceptable specifications such as decent RAM such as a minimum of 8 or 16 GB 
							of it or an average or above average CPU etc.  and a good SSD just to name a few which of course depends on which engine the game will be made and the modelling which mainly 3-D. In addition, screen monitors especially ones that have a decent to big size is preferable to be able to see and open up windows and references when making the game itself, having
							multiple monitors is however not required but welcomed. The feasibility finding the skill such as having a background in software development may be quite difficult as finding someone or people who can be reliable be it a veteran that has years of experience or a fresh graduate out of university. The software and hardware required is not really a problem since
							as mentioned, the game engine used is open for download for everyone and the hardware although might be a problem when finding specific components if needed if its not widely available or is popular. 

						   </p>

						   Outcome
						   <p>
							If this project would be successful and achieve its intended purpose of at least bringing the issue of climate change into the minds of players, information about it would be spread out with their friends, family or colleagues which is the optimal scenario which means that the game impacted and fulfilled its purpose as not only being a video game to be played for
							killing time but rather also a tool to educate people about the pressing issue. The original problem which is climate change itself has a much greater scale and can’t be solved by just a game or people just absorbing the information the game has given them and not doing anything about it. 
					                It takes the whole world to combat this problem and the game is there to serve as a stepping stone or a way of showing people how important it is to unite as one and combat and try to reduce even the most miniscule contributor of climate change such as using cars who 
							spew smoke when there’s public transportation available or using plastic bags and discarding trash everywhere which will eventually have a huge impact on the problem itself if people are educated and act upon what they have learned through credible sources and of course the game itself which started out as an idea. This project idea of having a video game created for people although a bit of a niche
							market especially targeted to the younger generation where they are the ones who may provide the answer to the pressing issue of climate change if the older generation does not come up with effective solutions in the future. The game will inform players the events or scenarios that might happen not to scare them or put a sense of false future but to educate and impact them on the severity of the situation
							 and how even their smallest ways could contribute to alleviate the problem.
